# PassionBy4.2

a start on the passion projects of cohort 4.2

Fork this project. Edit the ProjectDescription.md file.
If you want to make it fancy,learn how to use MarkDown as the
way to make headers, bullets, etc.

The first phase of this README, is to write less than 300 words on what you think you'd like to try to do.
Put that description into the ProjectDescription.md file.
