# PassionBy5dot0

a start on the passion projects of cohort 5.0

Fork this project. Edit the ListOfRepos file, adding your name and URL to the list.

In your passion project repo, the one that is pointed to by the URL you put in the list,
edit your `README.md` file with your writeup.
If you want to make it fancy, learn how to use [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) as the way to make 

## headers, 

* bullets, 
* lists
* and other useful
* etc.

In your passion project's repo, in README.md, is to write about 300 words on what you think you'd like to try to do.
Also put that description into the ProjectDescription.md file of your own repo. If you are uncertain about what 
project to do, put a list of all your ideas into the file.

This is an early "stake in the ground", not a contract to have to do your very first idea. You'll have plenty of chance to
think about it and modify as needed. But get *something* scratched out.

It's best if you write a few paragraphs on the idea itself. Something like 

> Figaro is a personal information manager that keeps your very important documents, notes and other
> digital assets safe and secure. It provides you instant, fingertip access to these personal 
> items, allowing you to share them with others who are important to you.
>
> It is both a mobile and desktop app, with an Amazon cloud-based backend storage vault.
>
> Figaro allows you to categorize various filings by various tags, and gives you clear control of
> the information you keep.

This kind of overview can help crystalize the way you think about your project, since you should consider:

* who your app/project serves (who is the user)
* what information the app tracks for them or provides for them
* what the backend/database tracks about your users
* what the overall user concepts areyou'd like the app center on
* what problems does your app/project solve

The app can be a mobile app or a desktop/laptop app, so dream big.
