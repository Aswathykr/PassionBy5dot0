# PassionBy5dot0

a start on the passion projects of cohort 5.0

Fork this project. Edit the ProjectDescription.md file.
If you want to make it fancy, learn how to use [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) as the way to make 

## headers, 

* bullets, 
* lists
* and other useful
* etc.

The first phase of this README, is to write less than 300 words on what you think you'd like to try to do.
Put that description into the ProjectDescription.md file. When you're done, commit it, push it and do a Pull Request.

This is an early "stake in the ground", not a contract to have to do your very first idea. You'll have plenty of chance to
think about it and modify as needed. But get *something* scratched out.

It's best if you write a few paragraphs on the idea itself. Something like 

> Folios is a personal information manager that keeps your very important documents, notes and other
> digital assets safe and secure. It provides you instant, fingertip access to these personal 
> items, allowing you to share them with others who are important to you.
>
> It is both a mobile and desktop app, with an Amazon cloud-based backend storage vault.
>
> Folios allows you to categorize various filings by various tags, and gives you clear control of
> the information you keep.

This kind of overview can help crystalize the way you think about your project, since you should consider:

* who your app/project serves
* what information the app tracks for them or provides for them
* what the backend/database tracks about your users
* what the overall user concepts areyou'd like the app center on
